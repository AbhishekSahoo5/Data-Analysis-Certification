  5) Tranforming Data
  ----------------------
      A) Transforming data in Excel with Power Query
      -----------------------------------------------
      B) Transforming data in SQL
      -------------------------------
          Sql--> Structured query Language
          --> A computer language that works with data in a relational database management system.
          Microsoft SQL Server
          ---------------------

      D) Common cleaning and tranformation
      -------------------------------------
            --> Spaces are characters that need to be removed.
            --> Leading spaces are at the front of a field.
            --> Trailing spaces are at the end of a field.
            --> Use functions like TRIM or CLEAN ro remove spaces.

            ---------------------------------------------
            ---> A relational database (RDBMS) is a type of database that stores and organizes
                    data in tables with defined relationships, making it easy to see how 
                    different data structures relate to each other.

            ** The rules for effective storage are eifferent from the rules used to combine data for reporting

              --> Product names
              
          If you don't have a master data management system, you need to developa plan to keep a consistent list of data.
          
      
      D) Unstructured data
      ---------------------
          Structured Data

      --------------
          1) What feature in Power BI automatically attempts to detect relationships?
                  --> AutoDetect (Power BI tries to join data automatically through 
                  AutoDetect. You should always confirm that the relationships 
                  it establishes are correct.)

            2) RDBMS stands for relational database machine systems.
                  --> False
                  
            3) A PDF of an organization’s annual report would be considered _____.
                  --> unstructured data (Unstructured data does not fit neatly into 
                  tables/spreadsheets. Examples of unstructured data are videos, 
                  pictures, and PDFs.)

            4)  What is an example of Master Data Management rules?
                  --> Master Data Management aims to keep a clean, complete, and accurate list of the master data for the organization.
                  This allows everyone in an organization who works with the data to have the same consistent list of information.


  7) Visualizing Data
  --------------------
      A) Visualization methods and best practises
      ------------------------------------------- 
          Be the person you are designing for.

              --. Title,label and add tooltips appropriately

        
      B) Creating reports to visualize your data over pages
      -----------------------------------------------------
          --> Reports with may line items and several pages are not best suited for a dashboarf representation.
          --> Not all data is best consumed using a dashboard
          --> Power BI Report Builder allows you to build paginated reports.
          --> Paginated report allow you to connect to data.
          --> Whst determines the style of your report is the need for how the data is best visualized and how it will be consumed.

      -------------------------------
      
      Chapter Quiz
      -------------
          Q1) Mockups help communicate the navigation of information.
                --> FALSE (Mockups demonstrate overall appearance, but a wire frame allows you to show the navigation between visuals.)

          Q2) What is an example of a visual element that should be included where appropriate in a dashboard?
                --> Be sure to title, label, and add tooltips appropriately. People should be able to read a title for context, understand the labels, and hover to get additional insight needed to support the visual—not just see the same thing that visual already shows.

          Q3) What type of command do slicers perform in a Power BI Dashboard?
                --> Filter  (Slicers are another way of filtering. They narrow the portion of the dataset that is shown in the other report visualizations. Slicers are a useful way to filter information and focus on a specific portion of the dataset.)

          Q4) What type of information is best displayed in a paginated report?
                  --> list of invoices for the year(Paginated reports can provide valuable reporting when your data expands over many pages and can easily be published or printed.)

          Q5) You notice that the numbers for your data project do not seem to match what the team expects. What is the first thing on your task list?
                  --> Verify your data set to ensure you have all necessary data and that you have not introduced an error.

            Q6) What shows by default on the tooltip for any visual you create?
                      --> the fields used for the visual(By default, when you add fields to a visual, they will display in the default tooltip.)
